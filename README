Database Repository for HellGround Core Project.

Folders:
dbcs - can contain dbc files converted to sql format for simplier access (can be helpfull while fixing something)
structures - contains sql files with databases structures and data updated to specific core revision (rev number is in struct_revisions text file)
tools - contains various sql tools
updates - contains updates to specific database
updates/*/old  - contains already applied updates to the base file (structures/*.sql or world.sql)
World database located in structures is an old dump and will not be updated by replacing the file.
To keep updated please check downloads tab. The filename contains core revision (bigger number) and db revision (lower number).


Changes linked with core will be still named as HG_corerev.sql
Structural changes would be named like this HG_corerev_tablename.sql
For DB only changes that do NOT require core changes mark as: HG_corerev_DB_dbrev.sql
If there is no new rev in core repository use the last one, the core rev number is important cause we also need a exact execution order also for DB only Updates.
Example: Core Rev xxxx changes structure of the World DB we need to execute db only changes on this table in the right order, else we have execution errors.
This makes more easy to use script to combine all updates to one file.
